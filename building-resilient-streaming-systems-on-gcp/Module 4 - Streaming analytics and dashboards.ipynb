    "### Overview\n",
    "At the time of this writing, streaming pipelines are not available in the DataFlow Python SDK. So the streaming labs are written in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab 3: Streaming Analytics and Dashboards\n",
    "Data visualization tools can help you make sense of your BigQuery data and help you analyze the data interactively. You can use visualization tools to help you identify trends, respond to them, and make predictions using your data. In this lab, you use Google Data Studio to visualize data in the BigQuery table populated by your Dataflow pipeline in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect to a BigQuery data source\n",
    "- Create reports and charts to visualize BigQuery data\n",
    "This lab uses Google Data Studio to visualize data in BigQuery using the BigQuery connector. In subsequent tasks you will create a data source, a report, and charts that visualize data in the sample table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Preparation\n",
    "You will be running a sensor simulator from the training VM. In Lab 1 you manually setup the Pub/Sub components. In this lab several of those process are automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Open the SSH terminal and connect to the training VM__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Console, on the Navigation menu () click Compute Engine > VM instances.\n",
    "2. Locate the line with the instance called training_vm.\n",
    "3. On the far right, under 'connect', Click on SSH to open a terminal window.\n",
    "4. In this lab you will enter CLI commands on the training_vm.<br>\n",
    "__Verify initialization is complete__\n",
    "5. The training_vm is installing software in the background. Verify that setup is complete by checking that the following directory exists. If it does not exist, wait a few minutes and try again.<br>\n",
    "`ls /training`<br>\n",
    "Wait until setup is complete before proceeding. You can verify the installation of maven with mvn -version and the JDK with java -version.<br>\n",
    "__Copy files__\n",
    "6. A repository has been downloaded to the VM. Copy the repository to your home directory.<br>\n",
    "`cp -r /training/training-data-analyst/ .`<br>\n",
    "__Set environment variables__\n",
    "7. On the training_vm SSH terminal enter the following:<br>\n",
    "`source /training/project_env.sh`<br>\n",
    "This script sets the **DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID** and **BUCKET** environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Creating a bar chart using a calculated field\n",
    "Once you have added the current_conditions data source to the report, the next step is to create a visualization. Begin by creating a bar chart. The bar chart displays the total number of vehicles captured for each highway. To display this, you create a calculated field as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Optional) At the top of the page, click Untitled Report to change the report name. For example, type < PROJECTID>-report1-yourname.\n",
    "2. When the report editor loads, click Insert > Bar chart.\n",
    "3. Using the handle, draw a rectangle on the report to display the chart.\n",
    "4. In the Bar chart properties window, on the Data tab, notice the value for Data Source (current_conditions) and the default values for Dimension and Metric.\n",
    "5. If Dimension is not set to highway, then change Dimension to highway. In the Dimension section, click the existing dimension.<br>\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "![](img/lab3-01.png)\n",
    "6. In the Dimension picker, select highway.\n",
    "7. Click the back arrow to close the Dimension picker.\n",
    "8. In the Metric section, click +Add Metric here and add latitude.\n",
    "9. Click the back arrow.\n",
    "10. In the Metric section, mouse over Record Count and click the (x) to remove it.\n",
    "11. In the Metric section, click the existing metric.\n",
    "![](img/lab3-02.png)\n",
    "12. In the Metric picker, click CREATE NEW METRIC.\n",
    "13. Click the button   Create a calculated field. To display a count of the number of vehicles using each highway, create a calculated field. For this lab, you count the entries in the sensorId field. The value is irrespective, we just need the number of occurrences.\n",
    "14. For Field Name, type vehicles.\n",
    "15. Leave the Field ID unchanged.\n",
    "16. For Formula, type the following (or use the formula assistant): COUNT(sensorId).\n",
    "17. Click SAVE.\n",
    "18. Click DONE.<br>\n",
    "**Add the metric**\n",
    "19. In the Metric picker, In the Metric section, click Add metric here.\n",
    "20. Select vehicles. Click the back arrow.<br>\n",
    "The Bar Chart will show an error. Do you know why?<br>\n",
    "**Verify that the value is numeric**\n",
    "21. Click on the pencil next to Data Source, current_condition.\n",
    "22. Examine the type associated with vehicles. If it is incorrectly set to timestamp, set it to numeric. Click Done. The error is corrected.\n",
    "23. In the Metric section, mouse over latitude and click the (x) to remove it.\n",
    "24. The Dimension should be set to highway and the Metric should be set to vehicles. Notice the chart is sorted in Descending order by default. The highway with the most vehicles are displayed first.\n",
    "![](img/lab3-02.png)\n",
    "25. To enhance the chart, change the bar labels. In the Bar chart properties window, click the STYLE tab.\n",
    "26. In the Bar chart section, check Show data labels.\n",
    "27. The total number of vehicles is displayed above each bar in the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Creating a chart using a custom query\n",
    "Because Data Studio does not allow aggregations on metrics, some report components are easier to generate using a custom SQL query. The Custom Query option also lets you leverage BigQuery's full query capabilities such as joins, unions, and analytical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can leverage BigQuery's full query capabilities by creating a view. A view is a virtual table defined by a SQL query. You can query data in a view by adding the dataset containing the view as a data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify a SQL query as your BigQuery data source, the results of the query are in table format, which becomes the field definition (schema) for your data source. When you use a custom query as a data source, Data Studio uses your SQL as an inner select statement for each generated query to BigQuery. For more information on custom queries in Data Studio, consult the online help.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To add a bar chart to your report that uses a custom query data source:\n",
    "2. Click Insert > Bar chart.\n",
    "3. Using the handle, draw a rectangle on the report to display the chart.\n",
    "4. In the Bar chart properties window, on the Data tab, notice the value for Data Source (natality) and the default values for Dimension and Metric are the same as the previous chart. In the Data Source section, click (Select data source).\n",
    "![](img/lab3-04.png)\n",
    "5. Click Create new data source.\n",
    "6. For Google Connectors, click BigQuery.\n",
    "7. For My Projects, click Custom query.\n",
    "8. For Project, select your project.\n",
    "9. Type the following in the Enter custom query window.\n",
    "`SELECT max(speed) as maxspeed, min(speed) as minspeed, avg(speed) as avgspeed, highway FROM [<PROJECTID>:demos.current_conditions] group by highway\n",
    "This query uses max/min/avg functions to give you the same for each highway.`<br>\n",
    "10. At the top of the window, click Untitled data source, and change the data source name to San Diego highway traffic summary.\n",
    "11. In the upper right corner of the window, click Connect. Once Data Studio has connected to the BigQuery data source, the results of the query are used to determine the table schema.\n",
    "12. When the schema is displayed, notice the type and aggregation for each field.\n",
    "13. Click Add to report.\n",
    "14. When prompted, click Add to report.<br>\n",
    "Data Studio may be unable to determine the appropriate Dimension and Metrics for the chart. This results in the error: Configuration incomplete - Invalid dimension or metric selected.\n",
    "15. In the Bar chart properties, on the Data tab, in the Dimension section, click Invalid metric.\n",
    "![](img/lab3-05.png)\n",

    "22. In the Metric picker, select avgspeed.\n",
    "23. Click the back arrow to close the Metric picker.<br>\n",
    "Your chart now displays the max speed, minimum speed and average speed for each highway.<br>\n",
    "Notice each bar has a default color based on the order the metrics were added to the chart.\n",
    "![](img/lab3-06.png)\n",
    "![](img/lab3-07.png)\n",
    "24. For readability, change the chart styles. In the Bar chart properties, click the Style tab.\n",
    "25. In the Color by section, click on the boxes to select different colors.\n",
